        letter: `I enthusiastically recommend Tom Stevenson for a Software Engineer position. I was Tom's supervisor at the University of Minnesota's Center for Writing from May 2024, when he began as a Junior Software Engineer, through August 2025, when he was a Senior Software Engineer. In those roles, Tom demonstrated extraordinary communication skills, combined with responsiveness, flexibility, creativity, and professionalism—a rare combination in any employee, let alone an undergraduate student. I value Tom as a colleague and thinking partner. He is always thinking of ways to make our systems better, and then implementing and improving those systems seamlessly. His curiosity and vision have enabled us to develop solutions that significantly improved accessibility and usability for students and staff alike. 

I have worked closely with our team of undergraduate software engineers for 20 years, and I can confidently assert that Tom is easily one of the two very best—in fact, given his many extremely high-level skills, I would characterize him as a prodigy. I hope you do not miss the opportunity to work with him.`

        letter: `Tom is inspiring; he is outgoing, proactive, and innovative. When I founded the AWS Cloud Club at the University of Minnesota, I knew I wanted Tom to be a part of my team. I was not only proven right about him, I was completely impressed. He was onboarded as a marketing officer, but he took on much more responsibility than that. When another officer had to step away from their position, Tom assisted me in completing their tasks. This was certainly not in his job description and was not asked of him. Tom is incredibly active in the computer science community and he was always coming up with new ideas to differentiate our club. He is a team player and he genuinely believed in our success. When it was time to set up my succession plan, Tom was the natural choice, and I’m very pleased to say he will be the next president. I can honestly tell you that Tom is one of those individuals who contributes so much value to a team that you don’t know what you’d do without them. Don’t miss out on an opportunity to work with Tom Stevenson, you’ll regret it.`
